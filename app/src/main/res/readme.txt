This is a custom view component for Android.

This was built as a proof of concept for detecting a user's input, to see if it was a circular motion.
If a circle is detected, the view will update with text that says, "Circle detected!"
Otherwise it will not.

You can run this view component on any android device or on an android emulator.

This code was made as an example and, as such, has no practical application.
However, if you would like to use this code in another program or component you may do so without my permission.
